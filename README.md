# spatiotemporal_classification
Bachelor's thesis investigating global wildlife classification using spatio-temporal contextual information.

## Summary
Automated wildlife classification is essential within ecological studies, wildlife conservation and management, specifically fulfilling the roles of species population estimates, individual identification, and behavioural patterns.

Current classification methods make use of deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in order to accurately classify wildlife species.
Wildlife sightings are prone to various forms of imbalance and noise, ranging from tourism bias (sighting time and species), through to weather and orientation requiring additional information to support CNN classification.

A proposed use-case utilizes tourist's public social media postings in order to support wildlife park's population estimates and tracking. 
Two considerations are kept in mind. Firstly, this information must be kept confidential in order to eliminate the threat of granting poachers additional knowledge. 
Secondly, the immediacy of social media posting and the staggering quantity of historical resources make it the largest potential source of wildlife historical and current data.
